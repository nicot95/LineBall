# LineBall

Android game

LineBall revolves around linking balls of the same color by tracing a path between them. Linking more balls will grant you a higher score, but it is also risky. If a ball touches a line linking two previously traced balls, it's game over.

LineBall is a round-based survival light-hearted game. Each round will throw more balls at you with which you can potentially make longer chains. But beware, more balls mean more threats . All this whilst trying not to run out of time!

Compete against your friends over three different modalities: Score, Longest Chain and Survival Round.
